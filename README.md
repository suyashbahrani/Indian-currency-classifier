# Indian-Currency-Classifier
This project is related to currency recognition of Indian Currency notes which is very useful for visually impaired persons and banking system for sortng the denominatons of the notes.
For this project we have used the approaches of Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, CNN, imageprocessing for extraction of features of currency notes. 

Different types of pre-trained models have been trained and tested like vgg16, Xception, InceptionV3, ImageNet, MobileNet etc and we achieved 91.76% accuracy for our classifier.

The model is deployed on web app as well as on andriod.For deployment we have used several platforms like flutter, Streamlit for creating web app and andriod app.
