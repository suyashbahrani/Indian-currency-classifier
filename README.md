# Indian-Currency-Classifier
This project was made during my internship with Bennett Unversity and LeadingIndia.AI. 
It is related to currency recognition of Indian Currency notes which is very useful for visually impaired persons and banking system for sorting the denominations of the notes.
For this project we have used approaches of Deep Learning, Transfer Learning, CNN, imageprocessing for extraction of features of currency notes. 

Different types of pre-trained models have been trained and tested like vgg16, Xception, InceptionV3, ImageNet, MobileNet etc and we achieved 91.76% accuracy for our classifier.

The model is deployed on web app as well as on andriod.For deployment we have used several platforms like flutter, Streamlit for creating web app and andriod app.

This project is built is using old Indian currency notes. I am now currently working on creating manual dataset which consists of new Indian currency notes including new denomination of 2000 & 200.
